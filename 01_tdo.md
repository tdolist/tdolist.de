## Usage

__Notice__: If you have todos or listnames with spaces do not forget to escape them or put the whole string in `''`.

For a list of all available commands please see `tdo help`, this is just an overview to demonstrate what you can do with tdo.

#### Simple todos
To add a todo, simply type `tdo add 'todo goes here'`. If your todo consists of just one word, you can leave out the quotes.

However, if you want to add the todo to a list _(for lists, see below)_, type `tdo add 'todo' listname`. Note that you can type the listname in lowercase letters, tdo will still find your list.

#### Multiple Lists
tdo features working with multiple lists. Add a new list with `tdo newlist listname` (remember to use quotation marks for a listname containing spaces!).

To remove it again, use `tdo remove listname`. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion to avoid accidents.

#### Export your todos
If you feel like exporting your todos _(e.g. for printing a checklist)_, you can do that with `tdo export filename`. All your todo lists will be exported into Markdown. You can decide if you want to include tasks that were marked as 'done' or not.

## Upgrade
If you want to upgrade from the older Python version of tdo there are some simple steps to follow.

First uninstall tdo with `pip3 uninstall tdo`. Dont worry the ~/.tdo folder won't be removed.
Then simply install the new one as shown above and you are ready to go.
